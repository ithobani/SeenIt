SeenIt is a Chrome extension that marks the YouTube videos you have already watched so that you can enjoy 
new content without having to sift through old videos yourself. 

You can also choose to have watched videos removed completely, rather than just marked as watched, 
via the options menu (click the SeenIt icon in the toolbar).
